# Next steps

## Read the article

This project is an open source project from [this tutorial](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/three-js-tutorial-to-build-your-first-browser-game-ae34bb0d351d), so thank you to Fik-shun for making this getting started project!

Read the article to see the additional things that were added to this project to understand how to build things with it.

## Debugging 

- In VS code, go to the `Run and Debug` tab, and then start one of the debugging apps. If you have Chrome start the Chrome one, if you have Microsoft Edge start the edge one.
- Once it launches, you can set break points in your app by clicking near the line numbers. This will be super useful to you as you start coding and will make you code much faster.
- See [this article](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging) for more info on debugging in VS Code!

# Further investigations

Added the code from [WarScript](https://github.com/jakewalker56/WarScript) to make a visualization of that game.
